#in python there is no need to specify the variable type
#Just specify a clear name
#ie

# NOTE: variable cannor beggin with number
# Example: 1age, 1_age

#BUT it can beggin with _ sign
# Example _age

name = 'John'
print(name) 

_age = input('What is your age?\n')
print('My age is ' + _age)

note = input('What do you recomend? \n')
print('I do recomend that ' + note)

# Variable Naming Rules
# i. Camal case: 
#     (First world start with small letter the rest start with capital letter)
#     Example:- myName, myVariableName

# ii. Pascal case:
#     Every word start with capital letter
#     example: MyVariableName, MyName


# iii. snake case:
