#ARTHMETIC OPERATION
#include +, -, *, ? %

# Difference between / and // 

#when / is used it return a float number

print(4/2)

#when // is used it return an int number

print(4//2)

# power is obtained by ** 

print(3**3)

#Multiple operators it follows the BODMAS rule automatic

print(3 + 2 * 6 // 3)

# Example in equation bellow
sam = 5 + 2 * 3 - 1 + 10/5

print(sam)

# From priority above multiplication will start followed by division, sub then add
